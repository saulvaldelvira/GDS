     * @brief Linked List structure.
     * 
     * \attention
     * To make this list "generic", nodes use void pointers to the elements they store.
     * When you delete a node, it is freed from memory. You can choose to also free the 
     * memory alocated for the element that node stores. The behaviour is defined by this two parameters.
     * 
     * @param free_on_node_delete If true, when deleting a node, the element it stores will also be freed.
     * @param free_on_list_delete If true, when deleting the list (by calling lnkd_list_free), all the elements it stores will also be freed.
     * 
     * \note
     * Sometimes you'll need the memory to be deleted, and sometimes that memory isn't allocated so you 
     * don't need to free those void pointers.
     * BE REALLY CAREFUL, because if you set those parameters to true and add elements to the list that don't need 
     * to be freed, you'll cause a segmentation fault.
     * \note
     *  The default value is 0 (don't free), so also keep in mind that unless you configure the list, that memory is not being 
     *  freed on deletion.
