     * @brief Linked List structure.
     * 
     * \attention
     * To make this structure "generic", nodes use void pointers to the elements they store.
     * When you delete a node, it is freed from memory. You can choose to also free the 
     * memory alocated for the element the node stores. The behaviour is defined by this parameter.
     * 
     * @param free_on_delete If true, when deleting a node, the element it stores will also be freed.
     * 
     * \note
     * Sometimes you'll need the memory to be deleted, and sometimes that memory isn't allocated so you 
     * don't need to free those void pointers.
     * BE REALLY CAREFUL, because if you set those parameters to true and add elements to the list that don't need 
     * to be freed, you'll cause a segmentation fault. Also, it could cause trouble to add elements wich memory has been allocated at
     * the same time. 
     * \note .
     * \note ***********CODE EXAMPLE****************
     * \note int *ptr = malloc (3 * sizeof(int));
     * \note ptr[0] = 0;
     * \note ptr[1] = 1;
     * \note ptr[2] = 2;
     * 
     * \note lnkd_list_append(&list, &ptr[0]);
     * \note lnkd_list_append(&list, &ptr[1]);
     * 
     * \note lnkd_list_remove(&list, &ptr[0]);
     * 
     * \note ****************************************
     * 
     * \note In this last instruction, if free_on_delete is 1, the list will free &ptr[0]. But ptr holds memory for 3 elements so 
     * &ptr[1] and &ptr[2] will also be freed. This will cause trouble if the list tries to access those already fred directions in the future.
     * 
     * \note To avoid this, you ca use the functions defined in "allocate.h", that allocate memory for the most common data types (alloc_int, alloc_char, alloc_float, etc)
     * 
     * \note 
     *  NOTE 2: The default value is 0 (don't free), so also keep in mind that unless you configure the list, that memory is not being 
     *  freed on deletion.
